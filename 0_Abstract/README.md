# ABSTRACT
#### In the fast moving world Car is very important mode of transport system. But in times of Rain it is difficult to look through Car making drive very difficult. So wiper system which helps to clear the Rain water on windshield allowing Driver to look through windshield during rain is important in Car. Wiper system consists of wiper drive and wiper arm. Wiper drive moves the wiper arm. But old wiper system has a disadvantage. That is when we activate wiper system to clear Rain water and deactivate it the wiper arm will not come to rest at 0 degree angle rather it will come to rest at the position where we deactivate it. So to avoid it from blocking driver to see through windshiel driver should deactivate when it is at 0 degree angle. This is difficult in many situations. So to avoid this advantage we need to add a mechanism to bring wiper arm to 0 degree angle every time we deactivate it. This is what we aim in this project.
